      <p><strong>(Carassius auratus)</strong></p>

      <p>
        The goldfish is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order
        Cypriniformes. It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China
        more than 1,000 years ago, where several distinct breeds were developed.
        It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most
        popular aquarium fish. Goldfish released into the wild have become an
        invasive pest in parts of North America.
      </p>
      <p>
        Native to China, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp
        family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp). It
        was first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 1,000
        years ago, where several distinct breeds were developed. Goldfish breeds
        vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration, and coloration
        (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black
        are known).

      <p>Anatomy of a Goldfish</p>

      <ul class="anatomy-list">
        <li>
          <p>Body</p>
          The shape is long and streamlined but not excessively long as Goldfish
          forage on the bottom for food rather than chase prey.
        </li>

        <li class="fins">
          <p>
            Fins (5 sets following the pattern of most of the Cyprinidae
            family:)
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Dorsal fin on the back, used for stability (single)</li>
            <li>
              Caudal (tail) fin, assists forward motion and direction (single)
            </li>
            <li>
              Anal fin, situated on the ventral surface of the caudal peduncle
              between the anal pore and caudal fin (single)
            </li>
            <li>
              Ventral fins, situated on the lower belly, used for stability and
              sudden stops (paired)
            </li>
            <li>
              Pectoral fins, situated just behind the gills, used for low speed
              movement (paired)
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Scales</p>

          Scales: Large, between 28 and 31 along the lateral line with a shiny
          metallic bluish-gray tinge.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Eyes</p>

          Situated on both sides of the head with little movement possible.
          Goldfish are considered shortsighted, relying on other senses to find
          food and warn of danger.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Operculum</p>
          Gill plate, one on each side of the head.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Lateral line</p>
          A series of sensory pits running from behind the gill plates along the
          side of the body to the end of the caudal peduncle. It detects
          vibrations and water pressure changes. Thermo-sensory nerve endings
          occur along its length so it is assumed that differences in
          temperature can be detected.
        </li>
      </ul>
